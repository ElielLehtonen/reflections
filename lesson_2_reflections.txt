What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
To initialise a git repository , you need to navigate to it and use the ‘git init’ command. This creates a .git metadata file, and the new repository can be examined with git status.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains files that are not yet in the repository, but are ready to be committed there. Thus, they are sort of in-between the working directory and the repository.
